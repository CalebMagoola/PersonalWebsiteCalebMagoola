        Hi! Thanks for visiting my website! I've built this page as an
        introductory project into Front End Development as well as another space
        to give an overview of my professional journey. I often introduce myself
        as curious, hard working, creative, ambitious, and team oriented. Yet as
        you explore this site, I hope you can see that for yourself along with
        everything else that makes me who I am.
