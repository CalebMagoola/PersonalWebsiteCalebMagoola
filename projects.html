        <h2>BlackJack Simulator</h2>
        <p>
          This was one of three major projects for Algorithms and Data
          Structures II. It uses ArrayLists and Random Generators to replicate a
          game of BlackJack between a user and a simulated player. It provides
          the ability to add a card to your hand (hit), displays your current
          card, and optimize your score based on if your Ace should be used as
          an eleven or a one. Here's the code:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/CalebMagoola/Blackjack"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><ion-icon name="logo-github" class="project-icon"></ion-icon
          ></a>
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Personal Website</h2>
        <p>
          You're currently already accessing this project! I used HTML and CSS
          to create this website, and may add some JavaScript elements to it at
          a later time. Through this project I've learned how to upload and
          style imagery, create links between pages and to other websites, and
          structure information in an effective and visually appealing way. I
          also learned how to position and resize elements and use classes/ids
          effectively. The most important thing about this project however is
          the fact that this was the first coding project I've ever learned from
          scratch on my own and created a functional product. Here's the code:
           <a
            href="https://github.com/CalebMagoola/calebmagoola.com"
            target="_blank"
            class="link"
            ><ion-icon name="logo-github" class="project-icon"></ion-icon
          ></a>
