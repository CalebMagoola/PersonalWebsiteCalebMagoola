        <h2>Volunteering</h2>
        <h3>Filmmaking Volunteer (CCATE) Jan 2022-May 2022</h3>
        <p>
          As a Filmmaking Volunteer, I help high school students create original
          film projects and documentaries that tell the story of their
          experiences as Latin Americans. Every week I film and take photos,
          edit film using Final Cut Pro, operate a shotgun microphone, and/or
          lead discussions about the creative direction of the project.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>2D Digital Art Volunteer (CCATE) Aug 2021-Dec 2021</h3>
        <p>
          As a 2D Art Volunteer, I assisted elementary school students create
          artwork with the software Krita. Each week I helped setup/clear the
          workspace, troubleshoot the laptops/software, and explain the features.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <h3>Intramural Sports</h3>
        <p>
          I play Flag Football, Softball, Soccer, Basketball, Dodgeball, and
          Ultimate Frisbee at the intramural level for Co-Ed teams and single
          sex teams. My Intramural Basketball team won the B-League championship
          in Spring 2021!
