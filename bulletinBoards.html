          Resident Assistants are tasked with creating decorative and
          informative bulletin boards to both beautify their hallway as well as
          provide residents with information that further helps them acclimate
          to college life and become better versions of themselves.

        <h2>Welcome To The City</h2>

        <p>
          This Bulletin Board informs readers/viewers of what kinds of people
          make up the community around them and how they can be better members
          of that community. The diversity in a dorm/university/etc. often
          mirrors the diversity of a city/town, so it's important to learn how
          to interact with a diverse array of people in order to go out into the
          world and create lasting and beneficial change. Estimated Build Time:
          6 hours.

          This Bulletin Board gave a general overview of notable campus
          resources available to all students to support them academically,
          socially, physically, mentally, and spiritually. The QR Codes led to
          the sites of different resources in particular for conveniency. The
          basketball theme was inspired by Villanova's dominant college
          basketball program, as all faculty and staff work as an elite team to
          help students become the best versions of themselves. #GoCats
          Estimated Build Time: 6 hours

        <p>
          This bulletin board considers the experience of having a college
          roommate for the first time. It provides advice concerning common
          issues/disputes roommates run into over the course of a year and
          resources/suggestions to alleviate tension and find short-term and
          long-term solutions. The theme is based on the video game Super Mario
          Bros. Estimated Build Time: 10 hours.

        <p>
          This bulletin board was the final one I built during the 2021-2022
          school year prior to spring exams. As burnout from the year hits many
          students during this time, it thus considers the stages of burnout,
          how to recognize them, and how to combat burnout. The visuals for this
          board were based on the show, Avatar the Last Airbender. Estimated
          build time: 10 hours.
