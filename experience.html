        <p>
          Additionally, I returning to my second year as a Resident Assistant
          (RA) for freshmen students in Villanova's largest residence hall
          (Stanford hall). I am a peer leader and peer mediator for a group of
          32 residents, and work with 14 other RA's to enhance community and

          memorable year of the college experience. In the 2021-2022 school
          year, I planned and facilitated over 10 events designed to bring
          students together including: a water balloon fight, a kickball game,
          numerous game watches, and more. To further inspire community I also
          am tasked with designing and implementing bulltin boards that are both
          informational and visually appealing. Check them on under the Bulletin
          Boards Page!
